Key factors such as family history, work interference, lack of anonymity, and inadequate supervisor support significantly influence treatment-seeking behavior. By addressing these areas through training, awareness, and accessible resources, companies can foster a mentally healthier workplace, leading to improved employee engagement, reduced burnout, and a stronger organizational culture.\n"
